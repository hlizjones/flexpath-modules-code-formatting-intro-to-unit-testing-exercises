Exercise 7: Managing Package Versions

Description: 

Explain the difference between installing a package 
with ^1.0.0, ~1.0.0, and 1.0.0 in the package.json dependencies. 

What do these version specifiers mean?

1.0.0 means it must match version exactly
~1.0.0 means it must be approximately equivalent to version → patch level changes 
^1.0.0 means it must be compatible with version → minor and patch changes
